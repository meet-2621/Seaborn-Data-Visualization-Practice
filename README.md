# 🐧 Seaborn Data Visualization Practice

## 📊 Overview
This project focuses on learning and practicing **data visualization** techniques using **Seaborn** and **Pandas** in Python.  
The dataset used is the popular **Penguins dataset**, which contains measurements for different penguin species.

Through this project, I explored how visualizations can help us understand data patterns, relationships, and distributions quickly and effectively.

## 🚀 Libraries Used
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis  
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations  
- **Seaborn** – Advanced statistical visualizations  
- **Matplotlib** – Underlying plotting library  

---

## 📈 Visualizations Practiced
✔️ Scatter Plot  
✔️ Strip Plot & Swarm Plot  
✔️ Histogram & Regression Plot  
✔️ Line Plot  
✔️ Bar Plot & Count Plot  
✔️ Box Plot & Violin Plot  
✔️ Heatmap (Correlation Matrix)

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
- Learned to customize Seaborn plots using themes, styles, and contexts  
- Explored different color palettes for better visual appeal  
- Understood how to visualize relationships and distributions effectively  
- Improved confidence in exploratory data analysis (EDA)
